The Department of Natural and Environmental Resources '(DNER) predetermined tree health rubric was utilized as one criterion to evaluate the success of this plan. Although the majority of the trees are in good health(2.86 out of 3 for all regions) the individual trees with poor health appear to exhibit similar characteristics that are in conflict with regulation 25. These characteristics that are indicative of poor health are directly related to tree species (native or exotic), soil condition and site selection .This indicates that Regulation 25 must be followed more closely. Results from community interviews show a strong interest among community members to contribute to the urban reforestation process; however, actual community participation was found to be at 36%, substantially less than the 97% who say that participation is important.

Indian cultures first populated this region but established communities high above or completely away from areas known to flood and focused technological advances mainly on survival skills rather than military purposes. When the Spanish first began to explore the area, initially looking for untapped resources and chasing myths and legends of hidden treasures, they found that their highly regarded armadas could not navigate the waters of the Colorado and were unable to flourish under these harsh conditions lacking steady lines of supplies and trade. After the land was acquired by the United States, the erection of small dams and diversion canals only complicated matters by causing floods in new places while still unable to prevent them in areas where they typically occurred. Following the restructuring of the Bureau of Reclamation, big dams such as Hoover, Shasta, Bonneville, and Glen Canyon, and the systematic planning of the Colorado River Basin, the river was soon brought under control and the human population soon flourished in the desert. Once established in this unforgiving environment, social concerns began to shift toward the environment and the overall quality of life rather than survival at all costs.",http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/iqp-all/5047,https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6046&context=iqp-all

Social and economic impact of biodiesel production.,"San Jose, Costa Rica",January 2006,Empresa de Servicios PÃºblicos de Heredia,"['Bergendahl, John A.']","Since the events of September 11, 2001, the U.S. has been concerned about the security of its petroleum supplies. In addition due to the vast majority of oil produced in OPEC member nations, they have the ability to fix prices above free market standards. Since the Yom Kippur war of 1973, OPEC has used their control of their share of the world's petroleum supply to influence the market and raise the price of oil. These events, as well as the phenomenon of global warming have made consumers look for ways to reduce their reliance on petroleum. This has taken the form of hybrid gas/electric cars and the attempted development of hydrogen fuel cells. However, hybrid cars still run on fuel imported from an oil cartel, and hydrogen fuel cells are at best high-yield batteries. The benefits of biofuels have become increasingly appealing in recent years as the cost for fossil fuels continues to rise and people become aware of the environmental impact of petroleum based fuels. While it is unlikely that biodiesel will completely replace conventional fossil fuels as the primary source of energy for transportation and heating purposes, the presence of a thriving biodiesel industry and other forms of ""Green Energy"" would give American consumers an option other than OPEC oil thus reducing the control of the oil cartel over energy prices. Currently, biodiesel production is insufficient to provide a complete alternative to petrodiesel, but with Federal grants and continued research and development, the biodiesel industry has potential for growth. This report outlines how the presence of an alternative to foreign oil will upset the balance of power in the energy market and force the OPEC oil cartel to maintain ""fair"" prices.",http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/iqp-all/3841,https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4840&context=iqp-all

Through site assessments and interviews with local farmers, we learned that there is a greater need for drinking water than irrigation water. Therefore, our design utilizes water- harvesting techniques to gather rainwater in a tank that can be used for irrigation or routed through a water-purification system for drinking purposes.",http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/iqp-all/71,https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&context=iqp-all

Hydrodynamics of the inner canals of Venice.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",January 1999,Dr. Manuel ValdÃ©s-Pizzini,"['Carrera, Fabio', 'Weininger, Stephen J.']","The canals of Venice are in need of constant maintenance because of sediment accumulation on canal floors. This accumulation of sediment results in problems for the city. Canals become too shallow to allow boat passage, sewer pipes clog which cause them to burst and accelerate wall damage to buildings, and health risks increase because of the presence of raw sewage. A complete characterization of the water flow through the canals is necessary for the creation of an effective schedule that will prevent severe damage caused by sediment. For this reason, a sedimentation model is being developed by the Institute for the Study of the Dynamics of Great Masses that is co-sponsored by Insula S.p.A. and UNESCO-ROSTE, the sponsors of this project. Our goal was to measure the maximum flow velocity that will be used to verify the sedimentation model, and be combined with other canal data for the purpose of developing an improved canal maintenance schedule. Maximum velocity data were obtained and used to calculate the Flushing Index, a number that measures the relative flushing ability of water flow through a canal. This number was then compared to sediment accumulation data. We observed that those canal segments with higher flushing indices had lower levels of sediment accumulation than those canals with lower Flushing Indices. This information will be useful in determining which canal segments will require more frequent sediment removal, allowing an effective long-term maintenance schedule to be developed that will minimize the problems caused by sediment accumulation.",http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/iqp-all/3897,https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4896&context=iqp-all

Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, which use a platinum catalyst, could place strain on the platinum market if fuel cell vehicles are widely produced. We developed a dynamic hypothesis, identified causal relationships, and created a system dynamics model in iThink. Based on this model, we found platinum prices would likely reach $50,000 per kilogram in 30 years and the cost of platinum for a fuel cell vehicle would be $2,500. At this price, the platinum barrier is surmountable if the cost of other FCV components is drastically reduced.

Wake heights of different boat types were measured, and the energy released by these wakes was calculated. The index was then created by assessing canal traffic patterns combined with the amount of energy released by different boat types when traveling at different speeds with different payloads. Additionally, this project new suggested traffic regulations that would reduce the total amount of energy in the system, and analyzed how probable traffic pattern scenarios would affect energy levels.",http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/iqp-all/4852,https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5851&context=iqp-all

Prospects for Hydrogen Fuel in the Early Future,New Zealand,March 2015,Callaghan Innovation,"['Elmes, Michael B.', 'Hersh, Robert']","This study explores the perception of renewable energy and hydrogen energy by the public and off-grid energy users to determine where and how HyLink™ might be adopted. HyLink™ is a prototype technology that uses electricity to make hydrogen gas from water. To date, user motivations for installing hydrogen power in off-grid applications has not been studied extensively. Interviews and surveys were conducted on the general public and renewable energy system (RES) owners to understand energy habits and perceptions of hydrogen energy. Due to a lack of information about HyLink™, current RES owners were unable to express a preference either for or against the technology. Our findings will assist the development of a communication strategy targeting the interested public and current RES owners.",http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/iqp-all/3095,https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4094&context=iqp-all
